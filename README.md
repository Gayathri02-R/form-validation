Registration Form Validation is a simple web application developed using HTML and JavaScript that demonstrates real-time form validation.
The form includes Name, Email, and Password fields, each validated dynamically as the user types.
The submit button remains disabled until all fields meet the validation criteria, ensuring accurate and secure user input before submission.
